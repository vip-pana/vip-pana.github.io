# portfolio

My portfolio is designed to be easy to navigate and intuitive, with a clean and modern interface. I hope you will find my experience and skills useful, and that you will be inspired by my past projects.
I realised the design using figma.

My portfolio is a website that showcases all of my projects, who I am, my qualities, and more. It was built using React with Vite and Chakra UI. The site is divided into two main sections:

### About
In this section, I talk about myself and my qualities. You will find a brief introduction about who I am, my key competencies, and my professional experience.

### Portfolio
In this section, you can find all my major works and links to their corresponding pages on GitHub. Here you can see the projects I have worked on in the past and their descriptions. You can also see the programming languages and frameworks that I used for each project.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
